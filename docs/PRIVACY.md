## Last Updated

September 28, 2025

## Overview

ChatGPT Message Cleaner ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear: **this extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or data.**

Specifically, we do not:

- Collect or store your ChatGPT conversations
- Track your browsing activity
- Collect personal information
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Store data in the cloud

## How the Extension Works

The ChatGPT Message Cleaner operates entirely locally in your browser:

1. **Local Processing Only**: All operations are performed locally in your browser tab
2. **DOM Manipulation**: The extension only modifies the visual display of messages on ChatGPT web pages
3. **No Data Transmission**: No data is sent to our servers or any third-party services
4. **No Persistent Storage**: The extension does not permanently store your conversation data

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions for legitimate functionality:

- **`scripting`**: Required to inject the message cleaning functionality into ChatGPT pages
- **`tabs`**: Required to detect when you're on a ChatGPT page
- **`host_permissions` for chatgpt.com and chat.openai.com**: Required to operate only on ChatGPT websites

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and nothing else.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there are no data security concerns related to our servers. All processing happens locally in your browser, which means:

- Your conversations remain private to you
- No risk of data breaches from our side
- Complete control over your data stays with you
